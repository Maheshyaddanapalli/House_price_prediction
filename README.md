Machine Learning project to predict house prices using regression models
🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies **Machine Learning** techniques to predict house prices based on features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and year built.  
It provides both a **Jupyter Notebook** for exploration and a **command-line training script** (`train.py`) for reproducibility.
